# Ride-Sharing Fare Prediction: Trip Data Analysis and Regression Modeling
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting ride-sharing fare amounts for trips in a major metropolitan city, based on several key factors. Using a dataset of 2017 Ride-Sharing Trip Data, the goal was to build a predictive model to estimate the fare based on attributes such as trip distance, trip duration, passenger count, and toll amounts. The goal was to understand the relationships between these variables and use them to predict the fare accurately.

Throughout this project, I applied various data science techniques such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling outliers, feature engineering, and model evaluation. The primary objective was to create a model that can predict ride-sharing fares for real-world applications while ensuring the data is clean and ready for analysis.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the 2017 Ride-Sharing Trip Data, which includes the following key features:

trip_distance: The distance traveled during the ride (in miles).
duration: The duration of the ride (in minutes).
fare_amount: The total fare for the ride.
passenger_count: The number of passengers in the vehicle.
tolls_amount: The total toll amount for the trip.
pickup_datetime: The pickup time for the ride.
dropoff_datetime: The drop-off time for the ride.
Data Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed to ensure it was clean and ready for modeling. This included:

Converting the pickup_datetime and dropoff_datetime columns to the proper datetime format.
Calculating the duration of each ride as the difference between the dropoff and pickup times.
Handling outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method for both the fare_amount and duration columns.
Scaling the features using StandardScaler to ensure that the model’s performance was not affected by varying scales of data.
Steps in the Project
1. Data Preprocessing
The dataset was initially cleaned using the following steps:

Datetime Conversion: The pickup_datetime and dropoff_datetime columns were converted to pandas datetime format for easier manipulation.
Duration Calculation: A new duration column was created by subtracting pickup_datetime from dropoff_datetime, in minutes.
Outlier Handling: Outliers in both the fare_amount and duration columns were detected using the IQR method and either capped or replaced.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand the distribution of key features and their relationships. The following analyses were performed:

Visualized the distributions of trip_distance, fare_amount, and duration using boxplots to identify any outliers.
Used correlation analysis to understand how different features are related to the target variable (fare_amount).
3. Outlier Detection and Handling
Outliers in the fare_amount and duration columns were identified using the IQR method, and extreme outliers were handled by capping or replacing the values to fit within a reasonable range.

4. Building the Multiple Linear Regression Model
The linear regression model was built to predict the fare_amount using the following steps:

Feature Selection: Selected features based on domain knowledge and correlation analysis, such as trip_distance, duration, passenger_count, and tolls_amount.
Data Splitting: The data was split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split.
Model Training: A linear regression model was trained using the selected features to predict the fare amount.
5. Model Evaluation
The model’s performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

R² (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable explained by the model.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors in the model.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Quantifies the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
6. Visualization of Results
Several visualizations were used to assess the model’s prediction performance:

Actual vs. Predicted Fare Amount: A scatter plot showing the relationship between actual and predicted fare amounts.
Residual Distribution: A histogram to visualize the distribution of residuals, checking for normality.
Residuals vs. Predicted Fare Amount: A scatter plot of residuals against predicted values to check for patterns in the model errors.
7. Model Coefficients Interpretation
The regression coefficients were analyzed to understand the relationship between each feature and the fare amount. The most significant features, such as trip_distance and duration, were found to have the most impact on fare predictions.

Key Takeaways
Feature Importance: The model revealed that trip_distance and duration are the most important predictors of fare in ride-sharing services.
Model Performance: The linear regression model performed well, with an R² score of 0.868, meaning it explains 86.8% of the variance in the fare amount.
Outlier Handling: Proper handling of outliers improved the model's accuracy by mitigating the influence of extreme values.
Model Interpretation: The coefficients showed how each feature impacts the fare, with trip_distance contributing significantly to the fare prediction.
